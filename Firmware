Instructions for updating the RN2483 firmware in LoStik.

Varinate 1: LoRa Development Utility by Microchip
1. Download and install the tool from here: http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/LoRaSuite-windows-1.0.exe
2. Download the latest RN2483 firmware: http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/RN2483_1.0.5_Oct%2031_2018_15.06.52.zip
3. Make sure you are using the file "RN2483_Parser.production.hex" which is located in the folder "offset".
   DON'T use the file "RN2483_Parser.production.unified.hex" wich is located in the folder "combined"
   (The file "RN2483_Parser.production.unified.hex" is just usable for the hardware programing tool PICKit 3 or 4 from Microchip.
    If you are using this hex-file with the LoRa Development Utility, the firmware programing process will crash.
    In such case, the LoStik and the RN2483 will not work anymore!
    Background: This file contains the bootloader and will overwrite the loader program in the RN2483.)
    
Variant 2: PICKit 3 (or 4)
> Variant 2 ist just necessary if you have crashed your LoStik with Variant 1
1. Open your LoStik and mount a plug connector (see picture)
2. Connect your LoStik to USB power
3. Connect the PICKit 3 programmer with your LoStik (make sure, you connect pin 1 with pin 1)
4. Set the target VDD source to "Force Target" (see picture)
5. Check the communication between PICKit3 and RN2483 (see picture)
   The tool should find the device "PIC18LF46K22" which is mounted in the RN2483
6. Chose the hex-file: RN2483_Parser.production.unified.hex (which is located in the folder "combined")
7. Press "Write" and RN2483 should be programmed.
